Async [Simple Service Discovery Protocol (SSDP)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Service_Discovery_Protocol), built on top of [ReactPHP](https://reactphp.org/).

SSDP is part of [Universal Plug and Play (UPnP)](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Plug_and_Play)
and is commonly used to discover network services on home networks without
requiring any manual configuration, such as automatically discovering printers,
multimedia devices and network routers.

This library implements SSDP as defined in the
[UPnP device architecture definition](http://upnp.org/specs/arch/UPnP-arch-DeviceArchitecture-v1.1.pdf) (PDF)
and uses HTTP over Multicast UDP (HTTPMU) as defined in the
[IETF draft](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-goland-http-udp-01).
As an alternative, some devices use DNS-Based Service Discovery (DNS-SD) instead
as defined in [RFC 6763](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6763).

## Quickstart example

Once [installed](#install), you can use the following code to search all available UPnP devices in your network:

```php
$client = new Clue\React\Ssdp\Client();

$client->search()->then(
    function () {
        echo 'Search completed' . PHP_EOL;
    },
    function($e) {
        echo 'There was an error searching for devices: ' . $e . PHP_EOL;
    },
    function ($progress) {
        echo 'Found a device: ' . PHP_EOL;
        var_dump($progress);
        echo PHP_EOL;
    }
);
```
